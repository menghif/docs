You can use [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) to host an Astro site for your [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) projects, groups, or user account.

## How to deploy

You can deploy an Astro site to GitLab Pages by using GitLab CI/CD to automatically build and deploy your site. To do this, your source code must be hosted on GitLab and you need to make the following changes to your Astro project:

<Steps>

1. Rename the `public/` directory to `static/`.

1. Set `outDir:public` in `astro.config.mjs`. This setting instructs Astro to put the static build output in a folder called `public`, which is the folder required by GitLab Pages for exposed files.

   If you were using the [`public/` directory](/en/basics/project-structure/#public) as a source of static files in your Astro project, rename it and use that new folder name in `astro.config.mjs` for the value of `publicDir`.

   For example, here are the correct `astro.config.mjs` settings when the `public/` directory is renamed to `static/`:

   ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-5}
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
   
   export default defineConfig({
     outDir: 'public',
     publicDir: 'static',
   });
   ```

1. Change the build output in `.gitignore`. In our example we need to change `public/` to `static/`:

    ```diff  title=".gitignore"
    # build output
    -public/
    +static/
    ```

1. Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the content below. This will build and deploy your site whenever you make changes to your content:

   ```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
   pages:
     # The Docker image that will be used to build your app
     image: node:lts

     before_script:
       - npm ci

     script:
       # Specify the steps involved to build your app here
       - npm run build

     artifacts:
       paths:
         # The folder that contains the built files to be published.
         # This must be called "public".
         - public

     only:
       # Trigger a new build and deploy only when there is a push to the
       # branch(es) below
       - main
   ```
</Steps>

## Additional Configurations

The [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) and [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) options can be set in `astro.config.mjs`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-5}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://<username>.gitlab.io',
  base: '/<my-repo>',
  outDir: 'public',
  publicDir: 'static',
});
```

### `site`

The value for `site` must be one of the following:

- The following URL based on your user name: `https://<username>.github.io`
- The following URL based on your group name: `https://<groupname>.github.io`
- Your custom domain if you have it configured in your Gitlab project’s settings: `https://example.com`

For GitLab self-managed instances, replace `gitlab.io` with your instance’s Pages domain.

### `base`

A value for `base` may be required so that Astro will treat your repository name (e.g. `/my-repo`) as the root of your website.

:::note
  Don't set a `base` parameter if your page is served from the root folder.
:::

The value for `base` should be your repository’s name starting with a forward slash, for example `/my-blog`. This is so that Astro understands your website's root is `/my-repo`, rather than the default `/`.

:::caution
    When this value is configured, all of your internal page links must be prefixed with your `base` value:

```astro ins="/my-repo"
<a href="/my-repo/about">About</a>
```

See more about [configuring a `base` value](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base)
